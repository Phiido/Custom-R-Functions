# Custom-R-Functions
My personal R functions that I've made for specific situations but more generic.

Functions:
get_libs - Dynamically load packages from input. Will ask to install if any are missing.

render_report - Render multiple Rmd-documents from vector of UID. Can be used inside %>% operator.
